# urban planning theory
survey of past, present and near future technologies and how they will affect the design of spaces

##### \*only tested on Mac OSX High Sierra 10.13.3

*app forked from this guy :
https://github.com/mobily/markdown-live*

*with slight edits to move the menu bar to the top to save previous screen space on the side*

## how to use mdlive to view markdown formatting

1. download nodejs
2. open a terminal in urban-planning-theory (parent directory)
3. type `node mdlive`
4. click on the .md file you want from the list on top (should only be two, the urban-planning-theory-readme.md and this readme.md)
5. open the .md file in sublime text 3 (or whatever text editor you like) and start typing!
6. whenever you save, the formatting will be updated to reflect your .md file
