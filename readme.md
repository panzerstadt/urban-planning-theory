# how to use mdlive
### only tested on Mac OSX High Sierra 10.13.3

app forked from this guy :
https://github.com/mobily/markdown-live

*with slight edits to move the menu bar to the top to save previous screen space on the side*

1. download nodejs
2. open a terminal in urban-planning-theory (parent directory)
3. type `node mdlive`
4. click on the .md file you want from the list on top (should only be one, the urban-planning-theory-readme.md)
