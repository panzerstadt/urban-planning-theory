# Authors

Marked takes an encompassing approach to its community. As such, you can think of these as [concentric circles](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951), where each subsequent group is enveloped by the previous one.

## Users

Users are anyone using Marked in some fashion. If you use Marked and would like to be added to a list of users, please reach out and let us know and maybe we can add you here or elsewhere.

## Contributors

Contributors are users who submit a [PR](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/pulls), [Issue](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues), or collaborate in making Marked a better product and experience for all the users.

To be listed here, just make a contribution and, if it has significant impact, the committers may be able to add you here. If you're name is here, and you would rather it not be, just let us know.

- Karen Yavine @karenyavine - Thank you for helping keep us out of the security penalyt box!

## Committers

Committers are contributors who also have the responsibility, privilege, some might even say burden of being able to review and merge contributions (just usually not their own).

- Tony Brix @UziTech - really good at the test harness and environment setup
- Federico Soave @Feder1co5oave - really good at the regex things
- Steven @styfle

Committers are usually selected from contributors who enter the discussions regarding the future direction of Marked (maybe even doing informal reviews of contributions despite not being able to merge them yourself).

## Admins

Admins are committers who also have the responsibility, privilege, and burden of selecting committers and making sure the project itself runs smoothly, which includes community maintenance, governance, dispute resolution, and so on. (Letting the contributors easily enter into, and work within, the project to begin contributing, with as little friction as possible.)

## Publishers

Publishers are admins who also have the responsibility, privilege, and burden of publishing the new releases to NPMJS and performing outreach and external stakeholder communications. Further, when things goes pear-shaped, they're the ones taking most of the heat. Finally, when things go well, they're the primary ones praising the contributors who made it possible.

(In other words, while admins are focused primarily on the internal workings of the project, Publishers are focused on internal *and* external concerns.)
