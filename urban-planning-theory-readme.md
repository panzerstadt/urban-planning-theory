### 1 Introduction
```
- what is urban design in a nutshell
- what does urban design attempt to solve
- two major factors
	- spaces
	- networks
- major urban problems we face today
- new technology and how it might influence urban design
```

### 2 Spaces - Commercial
Changes in how we perceive and use spaces cut across many industries, and as such defy segmentation into traditional delineations such as commercial, residential and business. The following is a cross-section of the key technologies that will lead to a major rethinking of spatial design at all scales.

##### 2.1 The Physical Shopping Experience
(cashier > self checkout booths > checkout-less shopping > ? )
```
1. mention extent of problem with references
2. discuss the current state-of-the-art
3. project changes to spatial design??
```

###### changes in shopping experience
1995 marked the year when both Amazon and Ebay came online and changed the commercial landscape forever. Suddenly, consumers can do comparison shopping, looking for the best services, lowest prices, and fastest delivery from the comfort of their homes [2]. Brand loyalty has now been shifted out of the cultural milieu [4], while trends come and go faster than retail stores can update their shelves [3]. The retail sector in America accounts for 10% of its entire working population, at 16 million people, a large portion of which is in danger of being replaced by self-checkout booths and fully automated stores [5].

###### self checkout booths
Large retail outlets and grocers are currently employing self-checkout booths in their stores with plans to replace manned cashiers, with 3.5 million jobs projected to be replace by self-checkout systems in America [5, 8]. These systems vary across generations from scanning the items from a shopping basket at the end of the customer's shopping experience, to scanning items as one is shopping, with mobile payments at the store exit [5].

###### fully automated grocery stores
History's first automated store belongs to Keedoozle from 1937 [6], but it faced similar problems that Amazon Go has today. The Keedoozle had problems with mixing up orders and conveyor belts couldn't handle peak traffic item delivery [6], due to the former's ticker tape system (for identification) and mechanical parts running conveyor belts. Amazon Go has a different customer identification system that employs multiple cameras and computer vision in tandem with various other technologies in a 'sensor fusion' [1, 7] in attempt to solve the very same problem. Reports of general robustness against theft and accidental shoplifting [10] indicate that the technology may be reaching a state where it is acceptable for production.

##### 2.2 E-Commerce // IS THIS STILL REQUIRED
(physical shopping > Paypal > Ebay > cryptocurrency > etsy merukari yahoo auction ? )

##### 2.3 Logistics
(warehouses > human workers > human + robot workers > robot warehouse management systems > ? )

###### warehouse
`WIP that automated warehouse thing and amazon and that robot company bought by amazon`

###### automation of order fulfillment
An ongoing competition held by Amazon seeks to solve the hard task of individually identifying, picking and stowing of items (for further processing and packaging), and the 2017 edition of the competition saw the winner inch closer to solving that problem [9].

###### frictionless shopping - reducing the pain of paying

> Imagine this scene from the future: You walk into a store and are greeted by name, by a computer with facial recognition that directs you to the items you need. You peruse a small area — no chance of getting lost or wasting time searching for things — because the store stocks only sample items. You wave your phone in front of anything you want to buy, then walk out. In the back, robots retrieve your items from a warehouse and deliver them to your home via driverless car or drone. [12]

Abstracting away the need to calculate the cost of purchases could potentially lead to more impulse purchases and overspending [11].

>“Based on data,” says Manoj Thomas, a professor of marketing at Cornell University, “we know that when people use any abstract form of payment, they spend more. And the type of products they choose changes too.”

However, professor Thomas also mentions that this abstraction can help people make good decisions. We would like to expand upon this thinking by exploring some alternative methods to inject customer experience back into shopping in a fully automated shopping environment.

##### 2.4 Commercial Spaces - The Trajectory for the Next 5-10 years

###### reduction of human labor
```reduction / replacement of simpler, repetitive tasks currently done by human labor with robots, augmentation of higher quality work with IoT```

###### speed and fineness of control
```faster, more control over the many moving parts that make up the current commercial industry```

###### less AND more control over purchasing decisions
```
- abstractions both bad and good
	- abstractions do not only need to be about money
	- abstractions of complexity for tasks that help customers make the right purchasing decisions
	- e.g. a quick price comparison app based on computer vision and RFID
	- balances the best parts of some aspects of shopping
		- trying on things for size
		- price comparison
		- 'hipster organic-ness' (locally sourced, no labor exploitation etc)
		- 
		- etc (MORE RESEARCH?)
```

###### proposed trajectory in spatial design
```
- spaces that facilitate
	- physical tryouts
	- quick restocking
		- moving the warehouse closer to retail storefronts
		- just-in-time restocking with more fine-grained robotic stock delivery
		(RESEARCH WHAT IS THE CURENT WORKFLOW OF RETAIL STOREFRONTS)
	- seamless payment
	- do grocery stores need to display multiple products on shelves?
	- linear supermarket
```

### 3 Spaces - Residential

##### 3.1 the Internet of Things (IoT)
(home products e.g. fridge, microwave > ioT > sensor driven cities > ? )

##### 3.2 Workforce Decentralization
(craftsman workshops > mass production > open offices > satellite offices + small office units > ? )

##### 3.3 The Software Landscape (microservices)
(small programs > google + ebay + Microsoft + sun microsystems > netflix microservices architecture > ? )

##### 3.4 Simulated Environments
(motivation behind VR / AR)

##### 3.5 Residential Spaces - The Next 5-10 years
